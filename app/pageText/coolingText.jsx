let textA = "There is a lot of competition in this part of the market. Every other pillow you see will say it's cooling. And if the ad text doesn't go that far, it will at least claim that the pillow is breathable. Most of the times neither of these things are true.";

let textB = "The majority of cooling pillows that are called cooling pillows either just have a cooling cover or they have a gel material mixed in with their  foam. Except in rare cases, the gel doesn't do anything. The cooling covers, on the other hand, aren't really cooling at all. They will feel cool for a minute or two when you touch first lay down on them. But that's more of a problem than a solution";

let textC = "What you can feel is the heat from your face or hand being pulled away from you and into the pillowcase. This is not nearly enough to cool your whole body; so that body part just gets hot again in a few minutes. But the heat that left you is now in the pillow, which is now hotter than even your most average non-cooling pillow. These products aren't just bad at doing what they claim to do. They actively make thinks worse, hoping to trick you. Or you might say, hoping to pull unbreathable polyester over your eyes. Forget about them, and don't look back. ";

let textD = "People can have different opinions about the remaining options. There are pillows with cooling gel on top so that you are protected from the part of the pillow that would draw in heat. There are pillows made up of proprietary foam blends. There are pillows made of latex, which doesn't absorb heat to the extent that memory foam does. Finally, there is an even older technology from Japan, the buckwheat pillow. Ok, it's not exactly a technology. But if you're enjoy a firm pillow, this is probably the coolest option. We've tried to offer a bunch of different options, from down to down alternative and from memory foam to latex";
