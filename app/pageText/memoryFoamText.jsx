const textA = "Memory foam pillows are a broad category. It is also one of the categories where there is the most disagreement between different pillow users. Unfortunately, there is a discrepancy between how often online reviews and rankings recommend memory foam (almost always) and how often they actually end up being people's favorite pillows (sometimes).";
const textB = "If memory foam pillows are your cup of tea, or if you're just continuing along your quest for a forever pillow, don't let the naysayers turn you away. But, at the same time, it becomes even more important for you to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff - so that you can find the absolute best memory foam pillow for you.";
const textC = "Two things seem to contribute to the confusion in this category. First, there are just an enormous number of baseless claims. Pillows promise to be cool or soft or firm or medium height when they are nothing of the sort.";
const textD = "Once you get past the false or misleading advertising, there is another issue that applies to pillows that actually are good. A lot of well-known/trendy brands make pillows in this category. Their products can be very well made, but they are only the best option for you some of the time. Memory foam pillows aren't for everyone. But if you know what you like, and you choose the right one, they can definitely be the perfect pillow for you.";
