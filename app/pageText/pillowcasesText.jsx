const textA = "Pillowcases can be made with a lot of different materials. Polyester, Poly-blend, Cotton, Rayon, Baboo (still rayon), Silk, and Linen are all options. The problem is that with most of these, you get what you pay for. Linen can be great for hot sleepers, but affordable linen pillowcases are only kind of affordable and quite scratchy. Silk is, well, silk. People claim that bamboo is comfortable; it certainly sounds nice. But as far as we can tell it is more expensive than rayon and yet essentially the same thing.";

  const textB = "Artificial materials, like polyester and rayon are often advertised as cooling, but this just isn't the case. Sure, these pillowcases feel cool to the touch when you initally touch one. But that's because they absorb the heat from your hand. When you lay your head on one of them for more than a few minutes, that feeling of coolness disapears and what you have instead is a hotter pillow that before. Don't let yourself be fooled by this trickery";

  const textC = "What you want, if you are in the market for a good, affordable pillowcase, is something that's 100% cotton. The options below all fit that bill, and they will all be a good choice for you. They'll be cooler than pillowcases made of other materials that advertise themselves as ice cold, and they will be more breathable than pillowcases that cost much more.";
